# CYBeat - Rhythm game for desktop

The project began from the 2019 Yang Chaoyue fans programming competition. The goal is to make a rhythm game for the desktop, where the player hits the notes to one of Yang Chaoyue's songs with keyboard input. This project uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library for C++.

## Progress as of May 2019
